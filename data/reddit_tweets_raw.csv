Court Dates & Market Reaction

	•	If the Supreme Court strikes them down, I believe we could see the biggest single-day stock market gain in history.


Some are saying this is a long shot, but from what I have seen, the Supreme Court has been showing consistency when faced with these constant unconstitutional EOs. 

The best part of this is that customs would follow the law and not a direct order from Trump on Truth Social. 

I have this in my wildcard for 2025 and I personally believe it would be the best case scenario for the markets and the future of our country. ",277,stocks
2025-05-03 12:07:23,Container Ship Transport is at the same level as a few months ago,"**EDIT:**

* But not at the same level as 2024, as 2024 had a very high volume of containers from China to USA as this statistics shows: [https://www.apolloacademy.com/trade-between-china-and-the-us-collapsing/](https://www.apolloacademy.com/trade-between-china-and-the-us-collapsing/)

[https://ibb.co/PZx4b26Y](https://ibb.co/PZx4b26Y)

The chart shows a notable decline in container ship volume (in TEU) departing China for the US since mid-April 2025. **This drop follows a sharp buildup over the previous months, likely driven by front-loading of shipments in an effort to avoid anticipated tariffs**. Companies appear to have accelerated their imports earlier in the year, temporarily inflating shipping volumes.

Now, as inventories are likely full and the tariff-driven urgency fades, volumes have corrected sharply.

**Interestingly, the current container volume has returned to levels similar to those seen months ago—suggesting a normalization in trade flows rather than a broader collapse in demand.**",0,stocks
2025-05-03 02:53:05,Is it possible that import front-running actually artificially buoyed GDP in Q1?,"So I've been digging into the mechanics of how GDP works a little bit more in the wake of all this tariff stuff. Follow me here for a second.

# Example 1:

Apple wants to front-run the tariffs and flies in a shit-ton of iphones, each costing $1000 (just to make the math easy).

The way GDP works is that the import cost (M) is offset by the addition to inventory - or investment (I).

The net effect of GDP, here is zero: GDP = +1,000 (I) -1,000 (M) = 0

Right off the rip, this puts to bed the idea that front-running imports is what drove down GDP. It has no effect.

But, it doesn't have zero effect. Because we need to include logistic costs. That iPhone was flown into an airport. The airport charges fees to the shipper. Laborers need to get paid for unloading the plane and loading trucks. Truck drivers need to get paid. Fuel is consumed. That $1000 base price of the iphone might have just jumped to $1,100 (probably less, but we'll run with it). 

So now, GDP = +$1,100 (I) - $1,000 (M) = +$100

Front running imports probably has an upward bias on GDP here.

It doesn't stop there. 

# Example 2

I'm having trouble coming up with a decent example, but say I'm a ball point, clicky, pen manufacturer, and I import my springs from china. I ordered a bunch of springs in March and I went ahead and built a shipment of pens to store in inventory. 

Say that the springs are only 10% of my unit costs at $1 per hundred pens. The other $9 is used to locally manufacture the rest of the pen. 

Here the GDP equation looks like this: GDP = +$10 (I) - $1 (M) = +$9

# TL;DR

In both of these scenarios, the pull forward in imports actually pulled forward future GDP and artificially lifts current GDP. 

If this is indeed the case, I think it's possible we see the real slowdown in the back half of the year when tariffs are well in effect.

In the early 2010s, China was a vital market for U.S. automakers like GM and Ford, but by Q1 2025, their ICE vehicle sales collapsed from 1.2 million to 250,000, despite China’s auto market expanding to 7.4 million. This decline stemmed from China’s rapid EV adoption—over 40% of sales by 2025—dominated by local brands like BYD and NIO, while U.S. firms stuck with outdated ICE models.

Geopolitical tensions, including Trump-era tariffs and rising Chinese nationalism, further accelerated the fall, with U.S. ICE sales dropping 17% year-over-year and imports down 66%. Even Tesla lost ground to stronger domestic rivals. National pride and policy-driven consumer shifts pushed U.S. brands to the margins, threatening their global relevance as China scales EV leadership and the U.S. risks isolation under flawed protectionist strategies.",306,stocks

The April jobs report showed the US labor market remained resilient after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" reciprocal tariff announcements shook markets.

The US economy added 177,000 nonfarm payrolls in April, more than the 138,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. 

In March, the US economy added 228,000 jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.2%. Those figures were revised Friday to reflect the economy added 185,000 jobs last month.

Average hourly earnings in April rose 0.2% over last month and 3.8% over the prior year. Economists expected wages to rise 0.3% over last month and 3.9% over the prior year.

Friday's report is the most notable piece of economic data released President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announcement on April 2.

On Wednesday, data from Bureau of Economic Analysis showed economic growth contracted for the first time in three years during the first quarter. A surge in imports ahead of the levies weighed on growth in the quarter.

Tariffs have also negatively impacted activity in the manufacturing sector and weighed on various consumer sentiment surveys.

Other labor market readings have also shown negative impacts from the rollout, or anticipation, of Trump's tariffs. On Thursday, data from the Department of Labor revealed weekly claims for unemployment benefits hit their highest level in two months during the final full week of April while the number of Americans filing for unemployment insurance on an ongoing basis reached the highest level since November 2021.

Private payroll data from ADP showed there were 62,000 private sector jobs created in April, the fewest since July.",161,stocks
2025-05-02 12:28:14,Shipping and logistics company predicting retail shelf shortage and mass layoffs,"A friend posted this on their socials today.

Here's an update that my company sent out yesterday talking about imports from China and how it's affecting the US. 
They're predicting layoffs in retail spaces and inventory shortages. As we all know, there have also been some crazy price increases, and companies passing off the tariff fees directly to the customer.
For those that don't know, I work for the 3rd largest freight brokerage and logistics company in the US. 
This is verified as data that is ok to share externally outside my company. 

Industry News, Speculation & Forecast:
a. China tariffs forecast to punch gigantic hole in US port traffic. While the U.S.-China trade conflict—driven by tariffs under President Trump—has spotlighted the decline in 
trans-Pacific container traffic, a deeper analysis of port-level data reveals a broader and more severe impact. Per the Census Bureau data, the list of American ports that 
processed the most containerized imports from China in 2024 was led by Los Angeles, at 22,237,485 million metric tons, or 51%, of the port’s total 43,912,894 tons of global 
cargo. China accounted for 8,341,200 tons, or 61%, of a total 13,592,209 tons through the neighboring Port of Long Beach, the second-highest total. Newark, New Jersey, was 
third and the leading East Coast gateway at 7,520,488 tons, a 23% share, of a total 32,995,507 tons. 'No way' US can recoup lost China container imports: Analyst

i. Import categories from China include items made of plastic including toys, household goods and personal care items, 46%; residential and office furniture, 46%; nuclear 
reactors, 41%; electronics ranging from big screen TVs to electric blankets, 40%; iron and steel goods, 47%; and toys and sports equipment, 88%. Companies are 
rapidly shifting their sourcing to countries like Vietnam, Thailand, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia in anticipation of the end of Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs.

b. Apollo Global Management forecasts a sharp domestic freight slowdown by mid-May, likely triggering mass layoffs in trucking and retail sectors. The ongoing freight recession 
is straining trucking firms, while retailers face inventory shortages, disrupted supply chains, and falling consumer demand due to tariffs and inflation. Consumer confidence is at 
record lows, with rising credit delinquencies signaling broader financial stress. Corporate spending is also dropping, with declining orders and rising inventories prompting 
investment cuts and potential layoffs across multiple industries. Mass layoffs in trucking and retail coming - Apollo",98,stocks
2025-05-01 14:29:44,Big Price Hikes Undercut Trump Bet China will Absorb Tariffs,"Surprise! 

From Bloomberg:

Donald Trump says China will likely bear the brunt of his 145% tariff on the world’s second-largest economy. But prices from some of the most popular sellers of made-in-China goods already suggest US shoppers will be paying a major portion of the bill.

A swathe of products on e-commerce giants like Temu and Shein Group Ltd. have seen prices soar in the US. A set of kitchen cleaning towels selling for $1.28 on April 24 set the outer limit with a 377% jump to $6.10 a day later. 

Discount retail app Temu is passing on nearly all of Trump’s new import taxes to US customers if they buy products directly shipped from China, with the cost of some products nearly doubling. 

At rival Shein, the average price for the top 100 products in each of two key categories — toys and games, and beauty and health — jumped by more than 40% as of April 29 from two weeks prior. Average prices for home and kitchen items were up more than 20%, while women’s clothing rose 9%. Cosmetic eyebrow gel previously sold at a retail price of less than a dollar surged overnight to $2.90. 

American shopper Priscilla Blazer has been shopping on Shein for the last six years, dropping about $100 every other month to refresh her work wardrobe and prepare for swimsuit season. But she’s been shocked at the recent price hikes, noticing the bill for some items has gone up by 50%. 

“I’m very upset because I really do like Shein,” said Blazer, 22, who works in corporate finance and lives in Tampa, Florida. “I’m probably not going to shop there as much and I’ll end up going to the mall.”

While Trump and his advisors have argued that short-term pain is merited to bring back manufacturing to the US, prices when more goods are made in America will also be more expensive, said Justin Lin Yifu, a former World Bank chief economist who has advised China’s top leaders.

“Even if production capacity is established after two or three years, the price of production will likely be higher than the price of imports,” Lin told a conference in Beijing in April. “During this time, the prices of goods will be very high, and supply will not be sufficient.”

2025-05-02 09:59:38,Bloomberg: China Hints at Possible Thaw with US on Trade,"China said it is assessing the possibility of trade talks with the US, the first sign since Donald Trump hiked tariffs last month that negotiations could begin between the two sides.

China’s Commerce Ministry said in a Friday statement that it had noted senior US officials repeatedly expressing their willingness to talk to Beijing about tariffs, and urged officials in Washington to show “sincerity” toward China. 

“The US has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China,” the ministry added. “China is currently evaluating this.”

Futures on the S&P 500 Index erased early losses in Asia soon after the statement, and a gauge of regional equities rallied to its highest level in more than a month. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index finished almost 2% higher in Hong Kong, while mainland markets were shut due to a holiday. 

The statement signaled the stalemate between the world’s two largest economies could shift, after Trump hiked US tariffs to the highest level in a century and Beijing retaliated in kind. Trump has repeatedly said President Xi Jinping needs to contact him in order to begin tariff talks. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it’s up to Beijing to take the first step to de-escalate the dispute.

John Gong, a former consultant to China’s Commerce Ministry, likened the latest gesture to “the first rain after a long drought.” It suggests “there’s a go-ahead from the very top of the leadership in China,” according to Gong, who’s now a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.

The economic fallout from the confrontation may be giving new momentum to efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table. The US economy contracted at the start of the year largely because of a monumental surge of imports to get ahead of the tariffs that have roiled global financial markets and caused consumer confidence to plummet.

In China, factory activity slipped into the worst contraction since December 2023, the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index showed this week. New export orders fell to the lowest since December 2022 and recorded the biggest drop since April that year, when Shanghai entered a citywide pandemic lockdown. 

But hurdles still lie ahead. Beijing has been looking for the US to appoint a point person for talks who has Trump’s support and can help prepare a deal that the American president and the Chinese leader can sign when they meet.

2025-05-02 09:49:28,Economic Recession Probabilities,"Probability of Recession:

	⁠•	⁠Some economists see a 90% chance of a recession by summer 2025 if the tariffs remain in place, citing significant disruptions in supply chains, layoffs, and business uncertainty.

	⁠•	⁠Other estimates are less severe but still concerning: Moody’s Analytics gives a 55% probability of recession within the next 12 months, while the IMF has raised its odds of a U.S. recession this year from 25% to 37%. JPMorgan economists put the odds at 60%.

	⁠•	⁠Mark Zandi (Moody’s) suggests a “serious recession” could occur if there is significant retaliation from other nations, estimating a 2% reduction in GDP and unemployment rising to 7.5%.

Recent Economic Data:

	⁠•	⁠The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, the first decline in three years, with imports and consumer spending both falling sharply.

	⁠•	⁠Business hiring has slowed, with job gains in April 2025 coming in at less than half of expectations.

Long-Run Impact:

	The Penn Wharton Budget Model projects that Trump’s tariffs will reduce long-run GDP by about 6% and wages by 5%, with all future households worse off.

	⁠•	⁠These losses are considered “twice as large as a revenue-equivalent corporate tax increase from 21% to 36%,” highlighting the tariffs’ significant economic distortion.

Recession Severity

Most projections now point to a moderate to severe recession risk if the tariffs are maintained or expanded, especially if retaliatory measures are taken by trading partners.

•	⁠The economic contraction so far is modest, but leading indicators (consumer sentiment, business investment, hiring) are deteriorating rapidly.

•	⁠The IMF and some private sector analysts still see a path to avoiding a full-blown recession if tariffs are eased or exemptions are granted, but this window is narrowing.

Eli Lilly (LLY-$700 billion market cap) CEO Dave Ricks emphasized that many essential hospital drugs, including generics, are produced overseas, mainly in India and China. With the U.S. reviewing the national security impact of drug imports, likely ahead of new tariffs, Ricks said the company supports reshoring key medicine production and is ready to help if needed.

US dependence to China for critical drug is not limited to Ibuprofen (95% reliance on China Import with shortage expected in few weeks) and other painkillers, but also antibiotics.

For instance, Cefuroxime, a widely used antibiotic, is expected to see sharp price increases due to rising manufacturing costs, supply chain disruptions, and a 145% U.S. tariff on Chinese pharmaceutical imports, which supply most of its key ingredients. A brief price drop in April was temporary, and India, once seen as an alternative source, also faces higher costs. Hospitals and generic drug makers may struggle, prompting early talks on subsidies, while patients are advised to explore alternatives.

2025-05-01 20:13:28,Airbnb issues disappointing revenue guidance for second quarter,"Airbnb reported results for the first quarter that were mostly in line with estimates, but the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the current period.

Shares declined about 4%.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 24 cents per share vs. 24 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $2.27 billion vs. $2.26 billion estimate.

Revenue increased 6% from about $2.1 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $154 million, or 24 cents per share, from $264 million, or 41 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.

For the second quarter, Airbnb said it expects revenue of between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, or $3.02 billion at the middle of the range. Analysts had forecast $3.04 billion in revenue for the current period. The company said it expects the period to include a two percentage point benefit due to Easter timing.

“In the U.S., we’ve seen relatively softer results, which we believe has been largely driven by broader economic uncertainties,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.

While the company said it experienced strong year-over-year growth in North America “despite broad macro uncertainty,” it reported “softness” in travel from Canada to the U.S. toward the end of the quarter.

Tariffs are the story of this earnings season, as investors look for signs that President Donald Trump’s sweeping levies on imports are weighing on costs and consumer spending.

Gross booking value, which measures host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, increased 7% year over year to $24.5 billion, in line with estimates. Night and experiences booked rose 8% from a year ago and totaled 143.1 million, compared to the 143.4 million estimate from analysts.

Excluding North America, Airbnb said that nights and experiences grew 11% from a year ago. Nights booked by Canadian guests visiting Mexico jumped 27% from a year ago in March. The company said it expects nights and experiences booked to “moderate” in the current period from the first quarter.

“During April, we saw strong demand for Easter travel from Latin America–which remains our fastest growing region,” Airbnb said.

Airbnb also teased new updates to its app coming later this month that will go “beyond places to stay.” The company said it has removed 450,000 listing since updating its host quality system in 2023.

Is this legit? hard to believe there isn’t enough ibuprofen manufacturing in the US: not even Merck? Johnson? Eli Lilly. Do you know any listed Us company that manufacture Ibuprofen ?

Apollo’s chief economist warned that the U.S. is heavily reliant on China for key drugs, including 95% of ibuprofen and most hydrocortisone, acetaminophen, and penicillin.

Over 90% of the U.S. supply of the anti-inflammatory steroid hydrocortisone comes from China, along with 70% of acetaminophen and 45% of penicillin imports. The U.S. depends heavily on China for low-cost generic drugs, which account for 90% of all prescriptions filled, according to the FDA.

Tariffs are already leading to supply strain, with companies pulling back due to rising costs. Sløk cautioned of looming “COVID-like shortages.”

>The ruling Communist Party's Politburo reiterated plans to accelerate debt issuance, ease monetary policy and vowed to support employers to safeguard jobs as China hunkers down for a trade war with the United States.

A few observations/questions:

* The Politburo making statements like that means they are worried about and do see domestic impacts from the tarriffs
* If China is already starting to see domestic turmoil, is that why the Trump administration is claiming that China will fold before we will? 
* Why isn't this being used as by the administration as propaganda to support their position?
* Why is this not being reported on in US news outlets?

It's hard to find information about this coming out of China. It isn't really on RedNote (Xiaohongshu) due to a mix of censorship and that app's audience (which is more upper middle class, not factory workers), and the sources I've found other than RFA are too obviously pro-US.

If China is already seeing domestic disruptions, it really underscores how much of a missed opportunity this is by simultaneously alienating every other country at the same time, instead of forming an alliance to pressure China on trade. Just utterly ridiculous.

2025-04-30 12:59:50,(04/30) Interesting Stocks Today - GDP Shrinks Amid Trade Turmoil,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Bad news economic data today, things are going to get wild.

News: [Us Economy Contracts For First Time Since 2022 On Imports Surge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge)

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)\- SMCI preannounced disappointing Q3 FY2025 results, with revenue expected between $4.5B–$4.6B vs. $5.5B expected, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.29–$0.31 vs. $0.54 expected. SMCI attributed the shortfall to delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves from older generation products. We're close to 20% down and with all the negative news on semi competition from China and server costs, I'm looking to play a bounce in this if the selloff gets worse. No real level I'm watching, likely will move with the market today. SMCI cited that inventory is increasing and as a result affected NVDA/DELL afterhours as well. DELL is down 6%! Potential supply chain disruptions like tariffs continue to be the biggest risk. 

[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d) / [**QQQ (NASDAQ-100 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)\- The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in Q1 2025, marking the first decline since 2022, driven by a surge in imports and decreased government spending. Jamie Dimon said that a recession is a ""best case scenario"", ultimately looking at how bad the selloff will be today. The broader market is grappling with uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and tariff implementations, and the contraction news. Might take a minor VXX long as well 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- DeepSeek released its Prover-V2-671B model on Hugging Face, a 671B parameter AI model trained on Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips. Obviously bad if Deepseek can release a competitive model that wasn't built on NVDA's chips like last time. This was also affected by SMCI news, so I'm interested in this today if we near $100 near the open.

[**SNAP (Snap Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&p=d)\- Snap reported Q1 2025 revenue of $1.36B vs. $1.35B expected, with a net loss of $140M, narrowing from the previous year. Daily active users reached 460 million, slightly above expectations. However, the company declined to provide Q2 guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Interested in this below $7, otherwise not interested mainly due to all the other things going on today. The digital advertising sector faces challenges due to changing trade policies and economic uncertainties, impacting revenue streams for advertising. Ultimately can be a huge loser if tariffs/recession goes through.

2025-04-30 12:44:30,US Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2022 on Imports Surge,">The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

>Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.

>Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.

|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GDP|\-0.3%|\-0.2%|
|Personal consumption|\+1.8%|\+1.2%|
|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\+3.5%|\+3.1%|

>The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.

>Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.

>The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.

>Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.

>Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.

>Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

I'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).

2025-04-30 11:00:17,The question everyone is asking. Why are stocks climbing when a recession looks more likely? Here’s one possible reason.,"The answer appears to be that currently The Street is forecasting a shallow recession and much of that is priced in. I am not sure how to square that with the fact that we have a near total trade embargo that is nowhere close to getting resolved with China that will impact many businesses and households. 

From MarketWatch 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that President Donald Trump was making more progress toward trade deals and a new tax bill, helping take some of the edge off Wall Street as a chaotic April draws to a close.

Optimism around potential deals, tax cuts and deregulation helped the S&P 500 index ￼ cement its longest string of gains since November.

Yet Trump’s extra tariffs unveiled on April 2, followed by a partial pause on April 8, have rattled global trade partners and added to an already sour mood among U.S. households and businesses. It also unleashed carnage in stocks and raised fears that the U.S. economy could tip into a recession — even if some trade deals were being struck during Trump’s 90-day pause.

“We moved to an expectation of a recession as a baseline on April 9,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist and head of asset allocation and quantitative services at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors. His firm’s biggest concerns have been that even if the newly imposed tariffs were removed, or dramatically reduced, baseline tariffs on U.S. imports would still be extremely high versus recent decades.

With that backdrop, the Wilmington Trust team puts the odds of a recession at about 60% over the next 12 months, and expects a short and mild downturn, while others have put the likelihood of a recession much higher.

So, why have stocks been rising? Aside from talk of Trump looking to pivot to more “pro-growth policies,” there’s a view that some of the damage in stocks in a mild-recession scenario has been realized already.

Tilley pointed out that the S&P 500 fell by as much as about 20% on a median basis during recessions in roughly the past 80 years. On a monthly basis, the peak-to-trough declines were less dramatic.

The S&P 500 ended 18.9% lower on April 8 from its Feb. 19 record finish, based on a closing low of 4,982.77, according to Dow Jones Market Data. When including April 7, it fell 21.3% on an intraday basis.

Yet perhaps more important, stocks have been able to turn around pretty quickly — with a median trough-to-peak recovery pegged at around 11 months, according to Tilley.

I think a lot of people are looking at this,” Tilley said, adding that even with the risks of a recession rising, more people appear to be willing to look through shorter-term volatility in stocks.

The S&P 500 has fallen 7.8% since Trump took office in January—on track for the worst start to a presidency since Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

But the period is ending on a strong note after the index notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Monday, the longest winning streak this year.

The next 100 days should feature several deals between the U.S. and its major trading partners. It’s already day 20 of Trump’s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that deals with India and South Korea are close.

There are more signs of tariffs being eased–Trump is expected to water down auto levies Tuesday and Bessent said it was up to China to de-escalate trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Both sides appear open to working things out.

While tax cuts may materialize in the summer, lifting consumers’ finances, the impact of tariffs will likely start to hurt them sooner, hitting shoppers and the economy hard–unless the White House rows back considerably on the levies it has announced so far.

There’s still time to avoid the worst of the damage. Corporate earnings so far paint a picture of uncertainty, rather than one of disaster–and the same can be said for economic data.

Earnings from four of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap stocks–Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple–will kick off the next 100 days. If the Big Tech momentum started by Alphabet last week can continue, then the market’s recovery can gather pace.

Ultimately, though, trade developments will dictate the market moves. After 100 days of nasty surprises, some pleasant ones may be on the way.

**Tariff Revenue So Far Falls Short of President’s Number**

President Donald Trump has boasted that his import tariffs are bringing in $3 billion of revenue a day, suggesting they could one day replace income taxes. But the Treasury’s daily statements show much lower tariff receipts, certainly not enough to replace the billions a day collected in individual income tax.

•	Since tariffs rates were raised to current levels on April 9, the U.S. has collected $14.7 billion in revenue from imports. While that’s a 135% jump from the same time in 2024 and higher than import revenue in March, it adds up to a daily average of $918 million, or less than one-third of Trump’s estimate.

•	Individual income tax totaled $6.6 billion a day last year. To reach that, tariffs would have to be 74%, which would effectively cut off trade and thus blunt tariff collections. Tariffs are currently set at 10% across the board, 25% for certain products, and 145% for goods from China.

•	Main Street is reacting to tariffs and Trump’s trade war by cutting jobs and slowing hiring, Hasbro is cutting $1 billion in costs, and Dow has postponed capital spending because of tariff uncertainty. Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George said the company is trying to “control the controllables.”

•	Chinese goods exported to the U.S. are expected to contract by two-thirds this year if tariffs are maintained, according to a Goldman Sachs report. Goods from the communication equipment, apparel, and chemical product sectors represent a high share of China’s U.S.-bound goods.",36,stocks

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

""I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable,"" Bessent said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

His comments come after President Donald Trump said last week that discussions with China were underway, refuting China's claims of no trade talks between the two countries.

On the positive side, however, Bessent said that they were making progress on other trade proposals, suggesting one with India would be ""one of the first"" to come. South Korea also hinted last week that trade talks were underway.

Investors are looking ahead to the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, which will see more than 180 S&P 500 companies report results. Four of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies— Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft — will release their quarterly reports, as will financial, staples and health care stocks Visa, Coca-Cola, and Eli Lilly.

Earnings results have been somewhat strong for the prior quarter, with 73% of companies reporting beating analysts' estimates so far — slightly below the 5-year average of 77%, according to FactSet data. Still, Wall Street is lowering expectations for the second quarter and the full year as companies come out with uncertain guidance because of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

This week will mark the end of April, which has seen stocks whipsaw across a wide trading range after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariff plans and then later walked some of the stiffer duties back.

So far in April, the S&P 500 is down by 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to lose 4.5% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%. The S&P 500 briefly entered a bear market on April 7 and has made a recovery since, but the index has failed to break through key resistance levels.

""While it may be too early to make the technical case for a bottom in beta underperformance, the recent rebound off key support implies investors should remain on high alert for a potential shift back toward risk-on leadership,"" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said.

The week also will see multiple reports on the labor market as well as key data on inflation and economic growth. Topping the list will be Friday's nonfarm payrolls release, while first-quarter gross domestic product and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will be out Wednesday.

2025-04-24 19:15:04,"GDPNow GDP Estimate is Wildly Misunderstood. The economy did not actually contract in Q1, it Grew.","People keep posting the Atlanta fed GDPNow estimate of -2.5%, and the threads always gain traction because doomer content always does.

However, people seem to be ignoring the actual REASON for the decline; Gold hoarding and pre-tariff import hoarding

GDP has 4 components: Consumption, Investment, Gov spending, and Net exports.

Net exports, in particular, is just exports - imports. The reason this is included is because if we import a lot of stuff, we didn't actually produce it, so this adjustment helps ensure we do not count consumption that we did not produce.(GDP is a measure of economic output, not living standards)

The -2.5% figure people keep citing includes imports of gold. The US has been importing massive amounts of gold due to investor interest. This massively distorts the net exports figure, as gold is extremely valuable.

Official GDP numbers exclude gold imports/exports, but GDPNow does not. However, they do offer a number that is adjusted for gold- that number is a decline of ~0.4%.

However, there is still a flaw with that number:

A) It is an annualized figure, so a quarterly decline of 0.1% is reported as 0.4%.

B) There is still a flaw with the number- it still excludes other net exports. And our net exports declined substantially in Q1, because of a surge in imports. Companies important several months worth of inventory to try and get ahead of the tariffs. As a result, GDP declined substantially, as imports reduced the number, while consumption did not grow as fast(because the products are sitting in warehouses).

In Q2, we will see a reversal of that trend. Imports will fall off a cliff due to tariffs, which actually pushes GDP UP(higher net exports). However, consumption is not likely to fall, as the stockpile of previously imported products get consumed. So Q2 GDP is likely to be BETTER than Q1 assuming no major shocks.

Excluding net exports, based on their projections, the economy grew 2.71% annualized in Q1.

**TL;DR**: Mass imports of gold by investors lead GDP projections down for technical reasons, but this won't be measured in official GDP figures. Mass imports in anticipation of tariffs lead GDP down temporarily for technical reasons(imports grew faster than consumption due to building inventories), but will be offset in Q2 when the opposite happens(consumption faster than imports).",0,stocks
2025-04-24 15:45:58,Lastest GDP Now Forecast -2.5% down from -2.2% for Q1,"The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the first quarter of 2025 is -2.5 percent on April 24, down from -2.2 percent on April 17. The alternative model forecast, which adjusts for imports and exports of gold as described here, is -0.4 percent. After recent releases from the US Census Bureau and the National Association of Realtors, both the standard model’s and the alternative model’s nowcasts of first-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth decreased from 8.9 percent to 7.1 percent.

2025-04-24 15:34:18,China tells US to ‘cancel all unilateral tariffs’ if it wants talks,"On 24th April, 2025, China's Ministry of Commerce stated that the United States must cancel all unilateral tariffs if it wishes to resume trade negotiations. The announcement reflects a firm stance from Beijing amid elevated trade tensions.

Chinese officials have also denied that any current negotiations are taking place, despite recent comments from U.S. leadership suggesting progress. In addition to reiterating their demand for tariff removal, China has introduced new export restrictions and initiated cases at the World Trade Organization.

Tariffs between the two countries now reach as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China and 125% on Chinese imports from the U.S.

This news happened afterhours yesterday (which is why all the car companies had a weird spike at the close). This is a rehash of the 25% tariff on all imported cars which was announced ahead of 'Liberation Day', so I don't think this should ultimately shouldn't have a massive effect on these stocks unless there are additional tariffs. 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles/automobile parts have been known for a while, so at this point I'll wait to see how car companies react at the open. The highest risk at the moment are retaliatory tariffs from Canada.

[**INDA (India ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INDA&p=d)\- Pakistan has suspended all trade with India, closed its airspace to Indian airlines, and rejected India's claims regarding a Kashmir attack, escalating tensions between the two nations. The geopolitical tension between the two countries has been going on for close to 100 years, watching to see if there's more escalation between the two countries.

[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)\- American Airlines reported Q1 earnings with an EPS of -$0.59 vs. -$0.69 expected and revenue of $12.6B vs. $12.5B expected. The company withdrew its FY outlook and provided weak Q2 guidance based on current demand trends. Interested in $9 level. Overall bearish but no position. AAL has fallen close to 50% since February, so I'm mainly interested to see if there is any chance of economic turnaround. There are some knock-on effects from tariffs due to fuel costs/economic prosperity of travelers for discretionary spending. Risks are typically continued persistently weak demand and operational disruptions (further plane accidents).

Overall more of a swing trade for the long term rather than a day trade, interested primarily in MATX. The shipping industry is experiencing significant disruptions due to trade policy changes; we'll likely see earnings affect a ton of these stocks and I'm interested if they give outlook during earnings.

Reality check: that’s still massively high and economically damaging. Trump is confusing people - and the market’s falling for it.

People underestimate how deeply tariffs reshape supply chains. This isn’t just about higher prices on imports - it’s about long-term disruption to how businesses operate, invest, and compete. Companies either move operations, find new suppliers, or eat the cost. Consumers always end up paying more.

A “cut” to 50%+ doesn’t solve the problem—it locks in trade barriers and normalizes uncertainty. The market’s reacting to headlines, but the long-term impact is still inflationary, disruptive, and anti-growth.

If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another. 

If you are an investor and stock holder, you are in this for the long-run. You are in this 10+ years. Even if your recession thesis plays out the market will recover.

2025-04-22 17:03:00,Schumer says Democrats will force Senate floor vote on Trump tariffs,"

From: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/schumer-says-democrats-force-vote-end-trump-20286193.php 


ALBANY — Democrats plan to force a floor vote in the U.S. Senate next week to reverse recent tariffs imposed by President Donald J. Trump on imports from other countries. 

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told reporters in Albany Monday that he thinks Democrats can secure the four Republican votes necessary for the resolution to pass.

“American families, restaurants and manufacturers will be able to breathe a sigh of relief if we can get that done,” Schumer said.
A similar resolution sponsored this month by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, wound up passing the Senate after four Republicans crossed party lines to support it. Schumer is trying to repeat that result.
The resolution would reverse the blanket 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. by ending the emergency declaration Trump has issued to impose them. It would also prevent Trump from using the same declaration to impose new tariffs.
“We believe the administration’s claim of an emergency is not justified,” Schumer said.
But the harder fight — and one in which Schumer has no control — is in the House of Representatives, where a majority of lawmakers would have to approve the resolution for it to become binding.
Republican leadership in the house, including Rep. Elise Stefanik from the North Country, has made clear that they don’t plan to stand in the way of Trump’s tariffs. Some lawmakers have offered support for his economic strategy.
The goal of the tariffs is to pressure other countries into trade agreements more favorable to the U.S. while providing a disincentive for consumers to purchase products imported from other countries.
“I strongly support President Trump’s America First economic policies to strengthen American manufacturing and create millions of American jobs,” Stefanik said earlier this month.

Stefanik is one of seven Republicans that represent New York in the House, where Republicans currently hold a seven-member majority.
Schumer employed a strategy on Monday that’s been used by several other Democrats from New York in recent weeks to apply pressure to Republicans, framing them as the final arbiters on whether prices will climb because of tariffs.
He called on the Republicans representing New York in Congress to bring his planned resolution to the floor of their chamber for consideration.
“If those seven went to (House Speaker Mike) Johnson and said to put it on the floor, he’d be under real pressure to do it,” Schumer said.

But at least one Republican is siding with Stefanik on Trump’s tariffs. Rep. Mike Lawler has said that Republicans are focused on other actions to lower costs as well, like removing regulations for businesses and boosting domestic energy production.
“This is about leveling the playing field, bringing tariffs down across the globe,” Lawler said in a televised town hall earlier this month.
That makes Schumer’s request unlikely at this point, leaving the tariffs in place. They’ve already started to have an impact on certain industries, including restaurants, which may have to raise their prices to maintain profits.
“Tariffs on food and beverages will place an additional strain on restaurants, ultimately leading to higher prices that will be passed on to consumers,” said Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association.

Other industries also haven’t been immune to the tariffs. That includes Latham Pool, a local business that happens to be the largest manufacturer of in-ground residential pools in North America. 
Tariffs on aluminum and steel have had the most impact on the business, said Scott Rajeski, the company’s CEO.
“We’ve created an ecosystem where we use the Canadian operations and our upstate New York operations to ship goods back and forth between the two countries,” Rajeski said. “It’s a difficult situation.”

Both chambers of Congress are scheduled to return to Washington, D.C., next week after two weeks off from session.

[**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NOC&p=d) \- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties.

[**JKS (JinkoSolar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JKS&p=d) \- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.

2025-04-21 18:26:29,"Amazon has paused some data center lease commitments, Wells Fargo says","Amazon has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, Wells Fargo analysts said on Monday, the latest sign that economic concerns may be affecting tech companies’ spending plans.

A week ago, a Microsoft executive said the software company was slowing down or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are the leading providers of cloud infrastructure, and both have ramped up their capital expenditures in recent quarters to meet the demands of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

“Over the weekend, we heard from several industry sources that AWS has paused a portion of its leasing discussions on the colocation side (particularly international ones),” Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. They added that “the positioning is similar to what we’ve heard recently from MSFT,” in that both companies are reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals.

Tech stocks have been pressured across the board his year as President Donald Trump’s proposals for widespread tariffs raised the prospect for dramatically higher costs on imports of equipment while also threatening to slow the economy. Cloud infrastructure providers have been aggressively announcing plans to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars securing Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) and building new data centers.

That was before the announcement on tariffs earlier this month. Microsoft and Amazon both report quarterly results next week. Their stock prices were down on Monday brining Amazon’s decline for the year to 25% and Microsoft’s drop to 15%.

An AWS spokesperson didn’t immediately provide a comment. Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin that he did not see the company cutting down on data center construction.

Wells Fargo has a hold rating on Amazon shares.

(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump would put the credibility of the dollar on the line and destabilize the US economy if he fired Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned.

“Donald Trump has hurt the credibility of the dollar with his aggressive moves on tariffs — for a long time,” Lombard said in an interview published in the La Tribune Dimanche newspaper. If Powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.”

The result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganization of the country’s economy,” Lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the US sooner or later to talks to end the tensions.

Lombard’s comments come after Trump, frustrated with Powell’s caution to cut US interest rates, posted on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.” It wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire Powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is May 2026. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday Trump was studying whether he could fire him.

President Emmanuel Macron has opposed Trump on a series of issues including Ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in France for US-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut.

Even so, Lombard’s comments are unusually direct about US domestic matters.

On tariffs, France’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from the EU don’t constitute “common ground” and that Europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the US.

The 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade,” Lombard said.

The finance minister also called on European CEOs to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out.

On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose group LVMH owns Champagne labels like Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot as well as Hennessy Cognac, seemed to suggest that EU leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs.",8265,stocks
2025-04-19 18:36:32,Buick finally had cars Americans wanted to buy - then came tariffs,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buick-finally-had-cars-americans-100252827.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buick-finally-had-cars-americans-100252827.html)

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors’ Buick was on a roll. Sales for the once-stodgy brand were up 39% in the first quarter with a refreshed lineup of compact SUVs including the Envision, Encore GX, and the Envista, its top-selling SUV for under $30,000.

Then President Trump’s tariffs hit.

Buick’s three most popular models are made outside the U.S. The Envista and Encore GX are both built in South Korea, while the Envision SUV is made in China.

That means all three are now subject to stiff tariffs that could add thousands to sticker prices on dealer lots in the U.S.

Buick’s South Korea-made models face a 27.5% tariff and the Envision out of China faces a steep 47.5% fee with a 25% auto tariff, a 20% China fentanyl tariff and a previously existing 2.5% auto tax, according to a Barclays analysis.

It's bad news for Buick dealers, which have been thrilled by recent models by the brand that has for years struggled to shake off a stereotype that may no longer apply.

Analysts believe higher prices could stall Buick’s momentum, and even threaten its survival.

""The latest wave of Buick vehicles is affordable, are good quality, are decent vehicles, and ruining that with a cost disadvantage could upset Buick as a going entity in the U.S.,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Buick declined to comment for this story.

RE-EVALUATING PORTFOLIOS

Trump's tariffs are pushing auto executives to analyze their portfolios and evaluate if the costs are worth it in the long term to keep importing some foreign-made models. The tariffs, enacted earlier this month, have already led to some changes.

GM moved to increase truck output at an Indiana plant and Stellantis, maker of Ram trucks and Jeeps, temporarily halted production at two plants in Mexico and in Canada.

In a Tuesday, April 15 note, Barclays said it's assuming automakers ""will no longer sell vehicles that cannot be sold profitably,"" including vehicles imported from China and Korea as a result of auto tariffs.

For GM specifically, Barclays expects the automaker will cease imports out of Korea and China of about 450,000 vehicles because of tariffs.

Barclays is cutting its 2025 GM earnings before interest and taxes estimates by 40% based on lower volume and the gross tariff impact of about $9.5 billion. For its crosstown competitor Ford Motor, Barclays expects a 60% reduction with a gross tariff impact of about $7 billion. Ford ships its Lincoln Nautilus from China.

Affordable vehicles like the Envista and Chevrolet Trax, both built in South Korea, stand to take the biggest hit from tariffs because automakers often build them outside the U.S.

The impact on affordable vehicles is an industry-wide concern with the average transaction price of a new vehicle in the U.S. ""north of $48,000,"" according to research firm Cox Automotive, which expects tariffs will cause a 10% to 15% increase in prices of affected models, and an overall 5% jump in prices of vehicles not subject to the levies.

STALLING THE NEW BUICK

Buick's lineup has either been replaced or refreshed in the last 20 months leading to sales increases. The brand’s yearly sales in 2023 increased by 61% and by 10% in 2024, according to the company’s sales figures.

The 2023 arrival of the Envista, a small SUV priced starting at $23,800, elevated the brand. New styling for the Envision, a compact SUV starting at $36,500, came last year, further amplifying it.

“Envision is the bestseller right now,” said Jeff Laethem, GMC and Buick dealer in Detroit. “Once they put the Envista styling on it, that's when it took off.”

Buick’s market share in the U.S. has jumped from 0.8% in 2022 to 1.1% in 2024 and 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025, according to data from Edmunds.com.

Buick has “probably the strongest momentum they've had in decades,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at research firm Edmunds. “If this momentum slows down, stalls or stops, then it’s not putting a nail in the coffin, but you're really ruining a good thing … it does dampen the dream of bringing back what was a very historic and important nameplate in the U.S. auto industry.”

Buick had a healthy supply on dealer lots as of early April with 53 days, above the industry average of 47, according to Edmunds.

While the global trade war continues, GM also has to consider the difficulties it’s facing in China, a leading market for the Buick brand. GM and other foreign automakers in China have been struggling to gain footing in a market overtaken by domestically-manufactured electric vehicles.

Buick's sales have declined in China by 65% from 2020 to 2024, according to data from Telemetry, a Detroit-area automotive advisory firm.

With tariffs and market uncertainty in China, there is a “risk to the survival of the brand,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of insights at Telemetry.",471,stocks

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering increasing its soybean and rice imports as a concession in trade negotiations with the U.S. over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, Japan's Yomiuri daily reported on Saturday.

With Trump's trade offensive roiling markets and stoking recession fears, Japan is seeking to walk back his ""reciprocal"" tariffs and other duties imposed on Japan, along with dozens of countries.

In their first round of bilateral talks on Wednesday, U.S. negotiators brought up automobiles and rice as areas where they said Tokyo puts up market barriers, and they demanded that Japan import more meat, fish products and potatoes, the newspaper said, without citing the sources for its information.

Japan's Cabinet Office could not immediately be reached for comment.

Those trade barriers are cited in an annual report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Japanese media highlighted a White House photo of the 400-page report on the table at the talks in Washington.

Trump unexpectedly brought Japan's lead negotiator, Economic Revitalisation Minister Ryosei Akazawa, into the Oval Office and touted ""big progress"" after the talks, although few specifics have been disclosed. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato is expected to resume the bilateral talks with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the sidelines of global meetings next week in Washington.

Japan has been hit with 24% levies on its exports to the U.S. although these rates have, like most of Trump's tariffs, been paused for 90 days. A 10% universal rate remains in place, as does a 25% duty on cars, a mainstay of Japan's export-reliant economy.

Akazawa asked the U.S. team to convey their priorities in order of importance, the Yomiuri said.

Trump has lambasted Japan for what he said was a 700% tariff on rice - a figure Japan says is based on outdated international rice prices.

It remains to be seen whether Trump's Republican administration would focus on rice, as exports to Japan come from California, a Democratic-leaning state.

Even before Trump's tariffs, Japan had been increasing its imports of staple rice in the past year as domestic prices have skyrocketed due to a supply shortage.",299,stocks

(Reuters) - Citi Research on Thursday raised its gold price target for the next three months to $3,500 per ounce from $3,200, driven by fresh gold buying from Chinese insurers and safe-haven flows amid tariff risks and market weakness.

""We think gold is likely to be in an extremely rare physical deficit at present, meaning prices need to rise in order to get stockholders to sell to clear the market,"" analysts at Citi said in a note.

The bank sees gold investment and industrial demand rising to 110% of mine supply in the second quarter, the highest level since the global financial crisis.

Emerging market central banks, including China's, are stepping up purchases, while investor appetite through exchange-traded funds and over-the-counter markets is also gaining pace due to global and U.S. growth concerns, Citi added.

The bank estimates that China's recent move to let ten insurers allocate up to 1% of their total assets to gold could generate annual demand of around 255 metric tons, equal to roughly a quarter of total global central bank buying.

“The prospects of further expansion in insurance gold buying imply further upside potential in China gold demand,"" Citi said.

China has also approved fresh import quotas and reopened the gold import arbitrage window after recent U.S. tariff announcements. This is expected to boost imports over the coming months, Citi said.

Citi raised its average gold price forecast for the second quarter to $3,250 per ounce from $3,100, citing rare supply tightness and rising demand.

The bank added that the gap between current forward prices and production costs, around $2,000 per ounce, presents a strong chance for producers to lock in healthy future margins, especially with the dollar weakening and interest rates expected to fall.",51,stocks

>On August 15, 1971, President Nixon announced the imposition of a ten per cent ad valorem surcharge on all dutiable imports. According to the President, the surcharge was necessary because an overvaluation of United States currency had created a situation in which United States imports were increasing faster than exports, contributing to a balance of payments deficit.

Sound familiar? The president complains about a trade deficit, and other countries weak currencies, and declares a 10% surcharge on all imports, to balance the trade deficit. This was later struck down by courts:

https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/09/archives/court-says-nixon-exceeded-power-on-import-surtax-ruling-could-bring.html



>In a decision that could lead to the refund of $500‐million to importers, the United States Customs Court ruled here yesterday that President Nixon had exceeded his authority in 1971 when he imposed a 10 per cent surcharge on all dutiable imports.

>In the main opinion, Judge Boe declared that Mr. Nixon's action, which was a part of his dramatic proclamation of the Phase 1 economic controls and related measures on Aug. 15, 1971, “arrogated” to the President “a power beyond the scope of any authority delegated to him by Congress.”

>“This court is not without appreciation of the burdensome problems encountered by the Executive as he represents these United States in the sod, ety of nations. Nor can the court fail to recognize the efforts of the President to achieve stability in the international trade position and the monetary reserves of this country. “But neither need nor national emergency will justify the exercise of a power by the Executive not inherent in his office nor delegated by the Congress. Expedience cannot justify the means by which deserving and beneficial national result is accomplished. To indulge in judicial rationalization in order to sanction the exercise of a power where no power in fact exists is to strilte  the deadliest of blows to our Constitution.”

(typos in digital article due to OCR errors when scanning the old newspaper article)

Edit: it was appealed successully and the tariffs were upheld.

The main difference now is that Trump used a 1977 law, IEEPA, to back the tariffs, whereas Nixon used TWEA(trading with the enemy act) to back his. There are some problems with Trump's declaration:

1. IEEPA does not explicitly authorize tariffs anywhere in its text, it has historically been used for sanctions(ie export/import bans, rather than tariffs, which are a tax, and only congress has the power to levy new taxes unless explicitly delegated to executive branch in law)

2. It is a stretch to claim that a trade deficit constitutes a national emergency that requires implementing tariffs affecting every country, including close allies, and on every product. 

There are already multiple lawsuits filed against these tariffs. One by California, and some by trade groups representing small businesses.

There is a very high possibility that these tariffs will be overturned by courts. If this were to happen, markets would likely rally 5-10% or more, just like they did when a 30 day pause was announced.

We can't know for sure what will happen, but this is a good reason to avoid shorting the market and getting burned. Stick with an asset allocation you are comfortable with and don't trade so much when the other side of the trade might have insider info.

**Edit: So in the case over 1971 tariffs, the US government actually won after appealing.** However, IEEPA has is much more restrictive than TWEA, and does not explicitly authorize tariffs.",1236,stocks

(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni that he expects to reach a trade deal with the European Union, but indicated he is in no hurry to finalize an agreement to reduce tariffs.

“There’ll be a trade deal,” Trump said Thursday, adding “I fully expect it, but it’ll be a fair deal.”

The president offered no time line for when he expected the first of the agreements to be finalized with trading partners seeking to avoid high tariffs, saying only that they would happen “at a certain point” and insisting that other nations would need to make concessions.

“We’re in no rush,” Trump added. “We are going to have very little problem making a deal with Europe or anyone else.”

Meloni thanked Trump for accepting an invitation to visit Italy “in the near future” and she expressed hope he would meet with EU officials to discuss trade. Securing face-to-face negotiations with the bloc would allow European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen an opportunity to speak with Trump for the first time, and would help cement Meloni’s role as a conduit between Europe and the US.

At the start of their meeting, Meloni had expressed optimism about striking a trade deal, but emphasized that Trump would need to engage with other European leaders saying, “I cannot do this deal in the name of the European Union.”

Meloni said she discussed with Trump areas where their countries could cooperate, including defense, space and on energy, adding that Italy “will have to increase its LNG imports.” Trump has made boosting US energy exports a key element of his trade agenda.

“The goal for me is to make the West great again. And I think we can do it together,” Meloni said.

Meloni’s Washington visit was closely watched by other trading partners eager for any insight into what concessions Trump is seeking. The Italian prime minister, who is an ideological ally of the US president and the leader of a Group of Seven economy, is seen as a potential bridge between his administration and the EU amid a trade fight that’s rattled financial markets and deepened fears of a global downturn.

Trump’s decision last week to pause high tariffs on the EU and other trading partners has sent foreign leaders racing to secure deals with the administration during a 90-day negotiating period. The EU faces a 20% “reciprocal” tariff if it doesn’t reach a deal with Trump — double the current rate of 10%.

EU officials are developing a proposal to restrict some exports to the US as a possible response if talks fail, according to people familiar with the plan. That measure would come in addition to retaliatory duties that Europe prepared but paused when Trump temporarily reversed course on his higher tariff rate.

Meloni, asked during the meeting if the EU would proceed with those additional tariffs, said she was confident in striking a deal to avert the tit-for-tat exchange.

Trump indicated he still foresees a “baseline of a substantial number” of tariffs on imports, suggesting that he would not abandon duties entirely.

Trump is personally involving himself in the talks with foreign leaders over trade, and Meloni’s visit comes a day after he hosted a Japanese delegation and spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US was prioritizing working with the world’s 15 biggest economies first, and said administration officials are expected to meet with negotiators from South Korea next week and said talks with India are progressing.

“We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do,” Trump said.

Italian officials ahead of Meloni’s visit conceded they held low expectations for securing an agreement in Thursday’s talks. US officials have indicated the bulk of the tariffs imposed on the EU would not be removed, and there was little progress made in trade discussions earlier this week between the two sides.

In addition to the baseline tariff, the US has imposed additional levies targeting sectors including cars as well as steel and aluminum. About 10% of Italy’s exports go to the US and some of its most important products, including autos, pharmaceuticals and food and wine, would be heavily affected by the tariffs.

Beyond trade, Trump is also pressuring on European security partners to boost military spending.

Italy has moved to raise defense spending in recent years and the nation, traditionally a laggard, is expected to reveal plans to meet NATO’s 2% target, Bloomberg has reported. That’s still considerably lower than Trump’s preferred threshold of spending 5% of gross domestic product on defense — and is nearly impossible for Italy to achieve without significant changes to its budget.

“Europe, as you know, is committed to do more,” she said Thursday, including working “to help the member states and increasing the defense spending.”

Meloni will return to Rome, where she is slated to host US Vice President JD Vance on Friday. Vance’s views on Europe have been openly antagonistic, highlighted most notably by an address at the Munich Security Conference this year where he scolded the continent’s leaders, accusing them of retreating from democratic values.",69,stocks
2025-04-17 19:05:54,EU weighs export restrictions on US if trade negotiations fail,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-weighs-export-restrictions-us-164330937.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-weighs-export-restrictions-us-164330937.html)

The European Union is working on a proposal to introduce restrictions on some exports to the US as a possible retaliatory tactic in the expansive trade war President Donald Trump initiated last month.

The restrictions would be used as a deterrent and only if negotiations with the US — which has put new tariffs on around €380 billion ($432 billion) of EU goods — fail to produce a satisfactory outcome, according to people familiar with the plan.

Such retaliation by the EU would mark an escalation in an expanding trade dispute as it could invite a forceful response from Washington. Trump threatened to put a 50% tariff on Canadian metals last month after Ontario announced plans to place a surcharge on electricity sent to the US.

An export restriction is one of several options the EU is considering, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Other possibilities include additional lists of tariffs and limiting public procurement for American companies.

A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to comment.

The people declined to elaborate on the specific restrictions the EU is considering and which sectors and products they would apply to. Such measures can normally be implemented in various ways, ranging from quotas and licenses all the way to outright bans on specific goods.

Typically these types of restrictions target goods critical to the country and that would be difficult to replace. China earlier this month added seven rare earths — with applications in smartphones to medicines — to its export control list. The US has almost no processing ability of those metals.

The EU and the US have so far made little progress in talks aimed at defusing the conflict. Ahead of a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday, Trump said he was “very confident” of a deal with the EU. European officials are hoping that the Italian premier can convince Trump to empower his trade officials with a clearer negotiating mandate, some of the people said.

The EU agreed last week to delay for 90 days the implementation of a set of counter-tariffs against the US over 25% duties Trump imposed on the bloc’s steel and aluminum exports. That move came after the US president lowered his so-called “reciprocal” rate on most EU exports from 20% to 10% for the same amount of time.

Trump has also imposed a 25% duty on cars as well as some parts, and his administration has moved forward with plans to impose duties on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports.

Trump has said that his global tariff strike is a bid to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US and raise revenue to pay for a tax-cut extension.

The EU’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington Monday. Sefcovic left the meeting with little clarity on the US stance and struggling to determine the American side’s aims, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The bloc is already working on plans for more counter-measures in the event they fail to reach a deal at the end of the 90 days. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated that another option could see the bloc target the digital advertising revenues of US tech companies.

Any further escalation beyond the existing tariffs may require political decisions from the bloc’s capitals before additional plans are drafted, one of the people said.",138,stocks

(Bloomberg) — California Governor Gavin Newsom said his state is suing to halt Donald Trump’s tariffs, setting up a high-stakes legal challenge to the president’s landmark effort to overhaul global trade.

The state will file a complaint Wednesday in San Francisco federal court challenging Trump’s use of emergency powers to enact broad tariffs against Mexico, China and Canada, according to a statement issued by Newsom’s office. Officials cited harm to consumers and businesses in the world’s fifth-largest economy.

Newsom, a Democrat who’s considered a likely candidate to run for president in 2028, and California Attorney General Rob Bonta will seek a court order to immediately block the levies. “President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs,” Newsom said in the statement.

Representatives for the White House didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on California’s challenge.

Trump’s unprecedented use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose tariffs on imports has rattled markets, prompted forecasts of a potential recession and strained relationships with overseas trading partners.

The IEEPA, passed in 1977, gives the president broad authority to regulate certain financial transactions when declaring a national emergency in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” It has traditionally been used to place sanctions on countries, companies and individuals.

Trump became the first president to use the statute to impose tariffs when he announced levies in February against China, Mexico and Canada to respond to the “extraordinary threat” of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs moving through US borders.

The president is already facing at least three legal challenges to his tariffs, though major industries caught in the tariff crossfire have held off from any legal action for now. Two complaints were filed by conservative legal advocacy groups on behalf of small businesses, and the third by members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana.

Justice Department lawyers have argued that all the cases filed so far should be handled by the Court of International Trade in Washington, which specializes in lawsuits against the government over trade issues, and are seeking to transfer cases filed in US district courts to the trade court.

# California Economy

California, a reliably Democratic state, has already challenged an executive order Trump issued to end birthright citizenship and the freeze on federal grants and loans.

Newsom during his governorship has positioned himself as a national voice on issues from climate change to abortion rights. His second term ends in 2026, leading to speculation he will run for president.

California accounts for roughly 14% of the nation’s gross domestic product, has a 40 million population and would be considered one of the largest economies in the world if it were a standalone country. Newsom has said that its economic weight gives California leverage on the global stage, but it also makes it vulnerable to tariffs.

The state plays a crucial role in agriculture and US manufacturing, including semiconductors, computer equipment and vehicles. It exported $24 billion in agricultural goods in 2022, nearly 13% of total US farm exports. Almonds were the biggest contributor at $4.7 billion, followed by dairy products, pistachios and wine, with top buyers including Canada, the European Union, China and Hong Kong.

Newsom has previously said he would try and insulate the state from Trump’s tariff plan by going directly to global trading partners and seeking exemptions, even though its unclear how he could pursue international agreements with foreign partners.

California plans to allege, like the previous suits, that the IEEPA doesn’t give Trump authority to impose tariffs and that his actions violate the law absent congressional approval, according to the statement from Newsom’s office.

Newsom and Bonta said the tariffs have an outsized impact on California businesses, including its more than 60,000 small business exporters.

>On April 1, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce initiated an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act (19 U.S.C. 1862) to determine the effects on national security of imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products. This includes, among other things, semiconductor substrates and bare wafers, legacy chips, leading-edge chips, microelectronics, and SME components. Derivative products include downstream products that contain semiconductors, such as those that make up the electronics supply chain.

The pharma one reads essentially the same.

I was under the impression when trump announced Section 232s on pharma and semis that it was going to start them at that time.  It looks like they are ahead of schedule, meaning this could be leveraged sooner than expected, especially if China continues to ramp up pressure as they have by preventing imports of US beef and soybeans.  On a side note, it looks like Australia is picking up the slack as far as beef goes for China.  It appears that Brazil is the current winner to pick up the soybean slack.

These tariffs, according to the administration, seek to strengthen national security by revitalizing manufacturing in the United States. However, the measures could have significant impacts, including:

1. **Supply chain disruption:** Tariffs could increase production costs and alter global supply chains, especially in sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals.
2. **Economic consequences:** Companies affected by the tariffs, both domestic and international, face financial risks as they try to adjust operations or absorb costs.
3. **Political and social impact:** The article notes that the measures could be challenging to implement quickly, with experts warning about effects on research and development, as well as on the prices of essential medicines and products.

2025-04-15 01:31:46,Asian Auto Stocks Rally on Signs of Trump Pausing Tariffs,"Shares of Asian carmakers climbed Tuesday after US President Donald Trump said he was considering tariff exemptions on imported vehicles and auto parts.

Japanese manufacturers Toyota Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Suzuki Motor Corp. surged about 5% in early Tokyo trade, with Korean maker Hyundai Motor Co. and its affiliate Kia Corp. both jumping more than 4% at one point.

The rally eased pressure on auto stocks after Trump imposed a 25% levy on car imports to the US on April 2, and fueled hopes of some support to the broader stock market. Car manufacturers were the biggest contributor to gains in Japan’s broader Topix Index, which was up as much as 1.5% in early trade. Korea’s Kospi Index rose as much as 0.6%.

Trump is beginning to show a “slightly more flexible stance on tariffs,” which is helping to support share prices, said Hideyuki Ishiguro, chief strategist at Nomura Asset Management Co. An exemptions for automakers would have a “significant positive impact” on Japanese stocks, as many companies are heavily dependent on exports to the US, he said.

(Bloomberg) — President Donald Trump’s administration pressed forward with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports by initiating probes led by the Commerce Department.

The moves, announced Monday in the Federal Register, are a precursor to imposing tariffs and threaten to broaden the president’s sweeping US trade war.

The Commerce Department said it would be investigating the impact on US national security of “imports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment” as well as “pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products” in a pair of notices posted to the Federal Register.

The US president has long decried foreign production of drugs and chips as a threat to national security and threatened to slap tariffs on imports in a bid to revive American manufacturing of those products. But the duties could also wreak havoc on supply chains and drive up costs for Americans.

New levies threaten to roil a chips industry that notched more than $600 billion in global sales of chips essential to products ranging from cars to airplanes and mobile phones to consumer electronics. Semiconductor supply chains still feeling the effect of disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic now could face new strains from the US duties.

The administration’s announcement came days after it exempted semiconductors, mobile phones, computers and other electronics imports from 145% duties applied to China. That announcement was seen as a boon to tech giants like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., but Trump and his advisers quickly said the relief would be short lived and that separate levies would be placed on chips.

Tariffs would also be a blow to the world’s largest drugmakers, including Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., virtually all of which operate scores of manufacturing sites scattered across the globe.

Trump, who has repeatedly bemoaned US drugmakers’ reliance on overseas production, is breaking decades of tradition. The pharmaceutical industry has long side-stepped trade wars, protected by international agreements that largely protected medicines from tariffs on humanitarian grounds.

Trump’s move on semiconductors is similar to the way he’s targeted other sectors, with imported steel, aluminum and automobiles already facing 25% tariffs and an ongoing Commerce Department trade probe expected to result in levies on foreign copper. The president has also vowed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and possibly critical minerals.

Under Biden, the US already had doubled tariffs on so-called legacy semiconductors from China to 50% and last December launched a probe into Chinese concentration in the category that sets the stage for Trump to impose even higher levies. While not as advanced as chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous in autos, airplanes, medical devices and telecommunications.

Trump has cast reshoring chipmaking and revitalizing the US industrial base as essential for the nation’s security. Winning a global race to dominate the AI industry is also a top Trump administration priority. Analysts have warned that bringing chip manufacturing to the US will take years of hard work work.

**Worldwide Impact**

The move on medicines will have an outsize effect on Ireland, with a $54 billion (€47.6 billion) trade surplus with the US that helped spur Trump’s wrath. The imbalance, heavily weighted by the pharmaceutical industry, stems from the country’s favorable tax regime and highly educated workforce. US drug companies, including Lilly and Pfizer Inc., operate nearly two dozen factories in Ireland that ship drugs to the US, according to a TD Cowen analysis.

The US biotech industry, which drives much of the innovation in drug development, is also vulnerable to the new tariffs. Nearly 90% of American companies rely on imported components for US-approved products, according to a recent survey by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. As a result, the supply of medicines for US patients and families are particularly vulnerable to proposed tariffs on the European Union, China and Canada, the group wrote.

Nearly all of the companies surveyed said they expect manufacturing costs to surge if import tariffs are placed on the European Union. Half of the 42 companies said they’d be forced to scramble for new research and manufacturing partners or they’d need to rework or potentially delay regulatory filings for new products.

“Re-onshoring key parts of the biotechnology supply chain to the U.S. and our allies and strengthening the American manufacturing base should be a high priority for both national and economic security,” BIO President John Crowley said in a statement. “It will take years, though, for this shift. We need to be mindful of the negative consequences of these proposed tariffs.”

**Trump’s Exemptions**

The US president earlier Monday announced he would consider temporary reprieves from his 25% tariff on automotive imports to allow companies time to bring production to the US.

The announcement suggested that the president was willing to negotiate with industry leaders, and a similar push from technology and pharmaceutical executives is almost certain to follow.

“He’s going to get this onshoring to happen as soon as possible and as orderly as possible,” Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Monday on Fox Business. “And so when he talks to CEOs and they say, ‘Hey, I need a little more time with this, I need a little time more more time with that,’ then he’s absolutely willing to listen. And if he’s convinced, then he’ll make the call to do something like he did today.”

Trump was asked what short-lived product exclusions he was considering but did not specify how long a potential pause or lowering of auto levies would remain in place.",307,stocks

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from [tariffs he previously imposed](https://apnews.com/article/autos-tariffs-trump-tax-imports-ford-gm-e53823ef7bbb7b3c46d11eca90aaa638) on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.

“I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. The Republican president said automakers needed time to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and other places, ""And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that.”

The statement hinted at yet another round of [reversals on tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-higher-rates-china-9645cf4608a8c153e90bdd10263ccb01) as Trump's onslaught of import taxes has [panicked financial markets](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-pause-businesses-reaction-a61a1adcaf6332f6188ae1d70664b898) and raised deep concerns from Wall Street economists about [a possible recession](https://apnews.com/article/recession-tariffs-economy-inflation-5a24ff198dcd6813b53f44c662354b6a).

When Trump announced the 25% auto tariffs on March 27, he described them as “permanent.” His hard lines on trade have become increasingly blurred as he has sought to limit the possible economic and political blowback from his policies.

Last week, after [a bond market sell-off](https://apnews.com/article/treasurys-bond-market-yield-tariff-46b4818710f01b8cc93fd002081167b0) pushed up interest rates on U.S. debt, Trump announced that [for 90 days](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-stock-market-china-recession-deals-e8e54a68397e6829e1d27552a1d7bfb9) his broader tariffs against dozens of countries would instead be set at a baseline 10% to give time for negotiations.

At the same time, Trump increased [the import taxes on China](https://apnews.com/article/china-us-trump-tariffs-2e05057e973e1e26d1b95c5be003b4cd) to 145%, only to temporarily exempt electronics from some of those tariffs by having those goods charged at a 20% rate.

“I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible,” Trump said Monday.

Trump's flexibility has also fueled a sense of uncertainty and confusion about his intentions and end goals. The S&P 500 stock index was up slightly in Monday afternoon trading, but it's still down nearly 9% this year. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were also elevated at roughly 4.4%.

Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.”

Tannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.”

The U.S. president also said that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and “helped” him recently. Many Apple products, including its popular iPhone, are assembled in China.

The Trump administration has suggested that its tariffs had isolated China as the U.S. engaged in talks with other countries.

But China is also seeking to [build tighter relationships in Asia](https://apnews.com/article/xi-visit-vietnam-china-us-trade-d7046613bff2c9ef31162ae8dd436263) with nations stung by Trump's tariffs. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Monday met in Hanoi with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam with the message that no one wins in trade wars.

Asked about the meeting, Trump suggested the two nations were conspiring to do economic harm to the U.S. by “trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.”",1876,stocks

>**In accordance with the April 11, 2025 Presidential Memorandum “Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as amended”** (the Memorandum), products properly classified in the headings and subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) listed in the Memorandum, are reproduced below. **All products that are properly classified in these listed provisions will be excluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257**, as amended, pursuant to Section 3(b)(iv) of that Order, effective for merchandise entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01AM Eastern Daylight Time on April 5, 2025:

You can check on the official white house website that **“Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as amended”** was indeed signed. 

This Memorandum applies to **EO14257**. EO14257 is the one signed on Liberation Day that imposed reciprocal tariffs on penguins. It has since been amended twice, (1) to increase tariffs rate on China, and  (2) to increase tariffs rate on China again, and to pause for 90 days for all other countries. 

\---

**What does this mean?**

The updated guidance by US Custom and Border Protection is accurate. It is consistent with what was published by the White House, signed by Trump. EO14257 no longer applies to this new set of goods. Since EO14257 currently applies only to China, effectively imports of those goods China is exempted from the 125% tariffs. 

\---

**But Trump said ...** 

It was misinterpreted. Go read it again. 

He said:

\- NOBODY is getting ""off the hook""

\- These products are subjected to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs

\- They are just moving to a different bucket

\- We are taking a look at semiconductor and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN

This is accurate. The memorandum (or exclusions) was made to EO14257. All other applicable tariffs / EOs on those goods still applies. (EO14257 excluded Mexico and Canada because tariffs were imposed on another EO. This means that the 90 days suspension of EO14257 does not apply to Mexico and Canada). 

They intend to tariff this group of products separately. 

\--

**So what should I do?**

In the market, idk. It's up to you. 

For investment in general - do your due diligence:

1. Go read the EOs

2. Go re-read Trump's post

3. Observe how many people (including news outlets) haven't done their DD. Use that to calibrate you how much you want to trust those sources.

2025-04-13 19:13:52,What should we expect from the markets on Monday after Trump suspended tariffs on smartphones and laptops?,"On Friday, the Trump administration announced a temporary suspension of tariffs on several key electronic products, including smartphones, laptops, memory chips, and other consumer tech items. These products were initially subject to tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, in addition to a general 10% global tariff.

The official reason cited was to avoid passing excessive costs onto U.S. consumers and to reduce pressure on major American tech firms—particularly those heavily reliant on Asian manufacturing, like Apple and Nvidia.

While markets reacted positively late on Friday, with a modest rebound in tech stocks, the bigger question is: what happens next?
	•	Could this lead to a broader tech-led recovery in the coming days?
	•	Or will uncertainty around future sector-specific tariffs (as hinted by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick) limit any upside?
	•	What are the likely short-term impacts on supply chains and investor sentiment?

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the administration's decision Friday night to exempt a range of electronic devices from tariffs implemented earlier this month was only a temporary reprieve, with the secretary announcing that those items would be subject to ""semiconductor tariffs"" that will likely come in ""a month or two.""

""All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored. We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels -- we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,"" Lutnick told ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.

He continued, ""So what [President Donald Trump's] doing is he's saying they're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two. So these are coming soon.""

The administration's clarification comes after a U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin was posted Friday night outlining key electronics -- smartphones, computers, solar cells, flat-panel TV displays and semiconductor-based storage devices, among others -- would be exempt from the tariffs announced since April 2. That meant those products would not be subject to steep tariffs on Chinese imports, nor the global 10% tariff rate President Donald Trump had imposed.

Lutnick said on ""This Week"" that the White House will implement ""a tariff model in order to encourage"" the semiconductor industry, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, to move its business to the United States.

""We can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need,"" he said. ""So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption. He's just clarifying that these are not available to be negotiated away by countries. These are things that are national security that we need to be made in America.""

# The Facts:

* On April 2nd, Trump issued Executive Order 14257 imposing tariffs on Chinese imports
* CNBC and analysts like Dan Ives immediately reported this would cause iPhone prices to spike to ""$3,500"" and devastate Apple's margins
* What they missed: **Section 3(b)(iv) of the order explicitly exempted semiconductors** and Annex II listed all semiconductor components (HTSUS codes 8541 & 8542)
* Section 3(f) clearly stated tariffs ""shall apply only to the non-U.S. content"" if the product has ""at least 20 percent"" U.S. value. Apple products contain significant U.S. intellectual property, design, and software. This provision alone would have substantially reduced any potential tariff impact.
* For an entire week, CNBC ran with the false narrative that Apple products would face crippling tariffs
* Apple lost approximately $640 billion in market value during this period (according to CNBC's own reporting)
* On April 11th, CBP issued guidance clarifying that smartphones (8517.13.00) and computers (8471) were exempt, consistent with the semiconductor exemptions
* Instead of acknowledging their error, CNBC reported this as ""Trump exempts phones, computers, chips from new tariffs"" - implying this was a new decision rather than clarification of the original policy

# Market Implications:

1. This represents a catastrophic failure of basic financial journalism - they simply didn't read the document they were reporting on
2. The same analysts who predicted doom (like Dan Ives) are now calling the ""exemptions"" a ""dream scenario"" and ""game changer"" without acknowledging their original analysis was based on a factual error
3. Investors who panicked and sold based on these reports potentially lost significant money for no reason
4. The situation demonstrates why reading primary sources is crucial for investors - even ""expert"" analysis can be completely wrong if based on incomplete information

Be careful if you're planning to make moves on Monday based on the reporting happening today. I bet you the ""smart money"" already knew this back when the original EO was issued.

EDIT 1:

I would encourage you to look at the original EO (https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-06063.pdf) and formulate your own opinion if the CBP memo is a material change or not. I am presenting the case that it's not. I would also highlight this is from CBP -- it does not mean that Trump cannot or will not move forward with his ""later date"" for semiconductors.

EDIT 2:

Until Trump or the White House issues a statement saying that a semiconductor-specific tariff is no longer going to happen, I would encourage you all to exercise caution.

EDIT 3: 

 The April 11 memorandum (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/clarification-of-exceptions-under-executive-order-14257-of-april-2-2025-as-amended/) from the White House did not introduce new exemptions but clarified what was already established in Executive Order 14257 issued on April 2. That order explicitly excluded semiconductors and certain electronics from the new ad valorem duties, listing them in Annex II. The April 11 clarification merely reinforced this by identifying the specific HTSUS codes—such as 8542 for integrated circuits and 8471 for computers—already encompassed by the term “semiconductors.” These exclusions have been in effect since April 5, meaning the latest media framing of exemptions as a material policy shift is inaccurate.",510,stocks

BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union and China have begun negotiations on the abolition of EU tariffs on imports of Chinese electric cars, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday.

EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic met China commerce minister Wang Wentao during a visit to Beijing at the end of March and both sides agreed to resolve a dispute over EU tariffs through negotiations, Handelsblatt reported.

The European Union imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) late last year, saying they were needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal was a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out.

If the deficit levels out some, it will have an impact.  Inflation dropped which might help consumer sentiment and spending (maybe even help to lower interest rates).  That said, the inflation drop was largely based on a large drop in energy which could shift.  Unfortunately, unemployment ticked up a bit.

My take was just saying that Fixed Investment up and trade deficit down could be enough to shift things up by the -.03% we are at.  I put above that comsumer spending was low.  It is a concern.

## Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Advance Estimate)

Real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2025 (January, February, and March), according to the advance estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2024, real GDP increased 2.4 percent.

Real GDP: Percent change from preceding quarter
The decrease in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected an increase in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and a decrease in government spending. These movements were partly offset by increases in investment, consumer spending, and exports. For more information, refer to the ""Technical Notes"" below.

Contributions to Percent Change in Real GDP, 1st Quarter 2025
Compared to the fourth quarter, the downturn in real GDP in the first quarter reflected an upturn in imports, a deceleration in consumer spending, and a downturn in government spending that were partly offset by upturns in investment and exports.

Real final sales to private domestic purchasers, the sum of consumer spending and gross private fixed investment, increased 3.0 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.

The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter.

2025-04-24 07:39:09,Is it too late to jump in PLTR?,"Someone told me might be good to ask here so..

In late December 2024, I read an article predicting PLTR could hit $100 by the end of 2024. The stock was around $82 then, and I doubted it would climb that fast after a 380% gain for the year.

I thought it would take years to reach $100. But on February 4, 2025, PLTR crossed $100 following strong Q4 earnings, even reaching $124.62 on February 18. I regret not taking it seriously, and now at $100.82 as of today (April 24, 2025), I’m wondering if it’s a good time to buy and hold through the next earnings on May 5.

Here’s what I saw last year. The article used 2023 numbers (revenue $2.2B, free cash flow $400M, 2.2B shares outstanding, market cap $78B at $32/share). It predicted revenue growth to 2030 with three scenarios Bull at 30% yearly growth, Base at 20%, and Bear at 15%. They thought free cash flow margins would hit 30% by 2030, used a 10% discount rate, and a 3% growth rate for terminal value. The estimated value per share was $75-85 (Bull), $40-50 (Base), and $30-35 (Bear).

So $100 by 2030 seemed like a stretch unless PLTR did better than the Bull case or got a high valuation boost. I didn’t think it would hit $100 in just one year.I was wrong. PLTR grew faster than expected. Q4 2024 revenue was $828M, up 36% from the year before, and they forecast 2025 revenue at $3.74B to $3.76B, well above the Base case. Q4 adjusted operating income was $297M, and full-year 2024 revenue reached $2.87B, up 29% from 2023.

The stock went up 340% in 2024 and another 50% in 2025 so far, driven by AI demand and retail investor interest. PLTR joined the Nasdaq 100, and their U.S. commercial revenue grew 64% in Q4. A NATO deal announced on April 14, 2025, has kept the momentum going, and X posts show investors are hopeful about PLTR’s future. Now I’m unsure. The stock has fallen to $100.82 from its February peak of $124.62, down 19%. Some analysts say it’s overpriced with a forward P/E of 158 and a P/S of 81, and they worry about Pentagon budget cuts since government contracts are 67% of revenue.

Others are optimistic, pointing to AI growth and partnerships with Microsoft and Amazon. The 2025 tariffs (25% on Mexico/Canada imports, 20% on Chinese imports) don’t directly affect PLTR since they focus on AI and defense, but market volatility from tariffs has impacted tech stocks, and PLTR dropped when the Nasdaq fell 11% in March. Earnings are on May 5, and analysts expect a move.

PLTR often rises after earnings, up in 3 of 4 quarters in 2024, but some say expectations are high, and a miss could lead to a decline. Management forecasts 36% growth for Q1 2025, and they usually beat guidance a bit. I’m thinking of buying now to hold through earnings, hoping for an uptick, but the high P/E makes me nervous, and I don’t want to buy at a high point.

Is $100.82 a reasonable entry point, or am I too late? Should I wait for a larger dip, or buy now to catch a possible May 5 earnings boost?",0,investing
2025-04-18 20:36:26,Buffett's alternative to tariffs is seriously brilliant (Import Certificates),"I'm honestly not sure how this hasn't been brought up more, but Buffett actually has a beautifully elegant alternative to tariffs that solves for the trade deficit (which is a very real problem, he said in 2006.... ""The U.S. trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil..."")

Here's how Import Certificates work...

* Every time a U.S. company exports goods, it receives ""Import Certificates"" equal to the dollar amount exported.
* Foreign companies wanting to import into the U.S. must purchase these certificates from U.S. exporters.
* These certificates trade freely in an open market, benefiting U.S. exporters with an extra revenue stream, and gently nudging up the price of imports.

The brilliance is that trade automatically balances itself out—exports must match imports. No government bureaucracy, no targeted trade wars, no crony capitalism, and no heavy-handed tariffs.

Buffett was upfront: Import Certificates aren't perfect. Imported goods would become slightly pricier for American consumers, at least initially. But tariffs have that same drawback, with even more negative consequences like trade wars and global instability.

The clear advantages:

* **Automatic balance:** Exports and imports stay equal, reducing America's dangerous trade deficit.
* **More competitive exports:** U.S. businesses get a direct benefit, making them stronger in global markets.
* **Job creation:** Higher exports mean more domestic production and, consequently, more American jobs.
* **Market-driven:** No new bureaucracy or complex regulation—just supply and demand at work.

I honestly don't know how this isn't being talked about more! Hell, we could rename them Trump Certificates if we need to, but I think this policy needs to get up to policymakers ASAP haha.

We made a full video on our YT channel, but I won't post a link here to respect the rules of the sub!

Hong KongCNN — 

China unveiled retaliatory tariffs of 84% on imports of US goods on Wednesday, further inflaming a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

The announcement means China has increased its intended levy on US imports by another 50 percentage points from the initial amount that was set to take effect on Thursday, matching the additional charge that US President Donald Trump has already imposed on Chinese goods.

Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect earlier on Wednesday. China was the hardest-hit nation with a levy of at least 104% on all its goods. The two countries have been involved in a game of tit-for-tat on trade, with Beijing standing firmly against each new tariff introduced by Washington.",757,investing

2025-04-08 05:32:25,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S. tariffs and tech curbs, like the Biden administration’s December 2024 semiconductor export limits. With 90% of heavy rare earths (like dysprosium, critical for EV motor heat resistance) processed in China, a full ban could cripple production timelines. The U.S. has only one active rare earth mine—Mountain Pass in California—producing 15% of global supply, but it lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity. MP Materials, the operator, ships much of its output to China for refining, and its Fort Worth magnet facility won’t be fully online until late 2025 at earliest.
Mitigation efforts are underway but slow. The U.S. is investing in domestic supply chains—Biden’s 2021 Executive Order 14017 and the Inflation Reduction Act pump millions into mining and recycling—but scaling up takes years. Alternatives like Australia (10% of global supply) or Vietnam exist, but their output is dwarfed by China’s, and processing still often routes through Chinese facilities. Recycling could offset 30% of future rare earth demand, yet only 1% is currently recycled in the U.S. Tesla’s shift away from rare earths in next-gen motors is promising, but it’s not yet scalable across the industry.
The EV industry faces a triple hit: delayed production, higher costs, and strategic vulnerability. A total graphite ban alone could slash EV output, given China’s 77% share of natural graphite and 95% of synthetic graphite production. Add rare earth curbs, and the U.S. could lose ground in the global EV race, with economic losses estimated at $3.4 billion in GDP from just gallium and germanium restrictions. Without rapid diversification or innovation, China’s restrictions could stall America’s electric dreams.

*It was the first time the index had closed below the 20,000-point mark since Aug. 5, 2024, when it ended at 19,830.88.*

*Monday's losses were the steepest ever in the Taiex's history, smashing the previous record of 1,807.21 also seen on Aug. 5, 2024, when disappointing U.S. data prompted investors to worry about the economy.*

**Despite the sell-off, turnover on the local market totaled only NT$147.295 billion (US$4.44 billion), the lowest single day total in more than two years.**

**""The low turnover showed many investors were reluctant to buy the dip as they expect more losses to follow due to the tariff shocks,"" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.**

*On April 2, Trump announced a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from most countries, with the exception of Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, starting April 5.*

*Countries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher tariffs starting April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).*

*China took retaliatory action soon after Trump's newest move.*

*""The 32 percent tariff Taiwan faces went beyond what the market had expected, in particular after TSMC pledged (in March) to pour an additional US$100 billion into Arizona in support of Trump's advocacy for investment in the U.S. market,"" Huang said.*

*TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, plunged 10 percent to close at NT$848.00, contributing more than 750 points to the Taiex's decline and contributing to a 9.71 percent decline in the electronics index.*

**""Orders to sell an additional 68 million TSMC shares failed to find buyers today. More selling will follow after the market opens tomorrow as investors fear Trump's tariffs will boost inflation and lead to a recession,"" Huang said.**

…

*Huang said non-tech heavyweights also came under heavy pressure, pushing the Taiex down further.*

*""There are few signs of any immediate rebound as the Taiex, which resumed trading today after the last session on April 2, needs to incur more losses to match global volatility,"" Huang said. ""So a similar trading pattern is likely for tomorrow.""*

*Measures to curb short selling were put in place before trading Monday and will remain in effect through Friday in a bid to calm the market, though it made little impact Monday.*
